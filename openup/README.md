# Open Unified Process

The [OpenUP-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenUP) describes:

> The Open Unified Process (OpenUP) is a part of the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF), an open source process framework developed within the Eclipse Foundation. Its goals are to make it easy to adopt the core of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) / Unified Process.

> The OpenUP began with a donation to open source of process content known as the Basic Unified Process (BUP) by IBM. It was transitioned to the Eclipse Foundation in late 2005 and renamed OpenUP/Basic in early 2006. It is now known simply as OpenUP.

You could download the full content "openup_published_1.5.1.5_20121212" from [EPF Project - Archived Process Downloads](https://archive.eclipse.org/technology/epf/library/index.php).

However, the content includes HTML files that are incompatible with Chrome browser, you need to use Microsoft Edge or IE to read it.

So I try to reorganize the content into several PDF files, includes:

* Overview
  * Getting Started

* The Delivery Process
  * Delivery Process
  * Inception Phase
  * Elaboration Phase
  * Construction Phase
  * Transition Phase

In the following I list links to some useful resources:
